## Background and Overview

  **ZumaInfinite** is a classic game comprising of balls of four colors i.e. red, blue, yellow and green
  ,a frog controlled by user in the center and a skull emblem.
  User can shoot balls from frog in any direction to make group of three or more same colored balls, in which case the balls explode and user gets points depending on number
  of balls exploded. The difficulty increases to four balls after user blows certain number of balls.
  Chain of balls proceeds in spiral towards the skull emblem and when it reaches the skull emblem the game ends.
  The goal of user here is to shoot balls in appropriate direction so balls explode and hence go away.
  Currently there are 30 balls but I might keep changing number of balls or even make it infinite from time to time so come back to challenge yourself. :)


  This project was implemented using following technologies:

  - HTML5 Canvas for DOM manipulation and rendering,
  - Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.
  - Vanilla JavaScript for game structure and game logic,
  - WebAudioAPI was used for sound generation, processing and control.
